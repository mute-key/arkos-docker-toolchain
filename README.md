# ArkOS Docker SDK

ArkOS is a linux distribution based on Ubuntu 19.10. For simplicity, I made
a Docker to build quicker my apps on my computer.

This Docker reproduce the ArkOS 2.0 environement as a aarch64 image, it doesn't
provide a full cross-compiling environement.
```bash
$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t arkos-sdk .
# In your project folder...
$ docker run -it --volume=$(pwd):/work/ --workdir=/work/ --rm arkos-sdk
root@920e9eb0a553:/work# # Do stuff here
```

On x86, you may need to install qemu-user-static to run the image.
